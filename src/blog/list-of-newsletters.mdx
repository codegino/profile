Being in a fast-paced industry,  we need to update our skills to stay relevant to perform our jobs better(to get a better salary). For me, having a short attention span is a challenge; one minute, I'm watching a YouTube tutorial, next, I'm watching random nonsense internet content. Therefore, I find subscribing to newsletters a concise way to learn new things without too many distractions.

<br />

**Here are some on my list:**

<br />

### [React News Letter](https://reactnewsletter.com/)
> Stay up to date on the latest React news, tutorials, resources, and more. Delivered every Tuesday, for free.

Since developing React applications are my bread and butter, this is a must for me. _If you're working on another language, there's likely a newsletter for that._

<br />

### [Bytes](https://bytes.dev?x=1095221753)
#### Become a smarter JavaScript developer
> Staying informed on the JavaScript ecosystem has never been so entertaining. Delivered every Monday, for free.

Aside from providing JavaScript updates, what I like most about this newsletter is its sense of humor.

Just check this one. :D

### [DEV Community Digest](https://dev.to/settings/notifications)
By enabling a newsletter in your settings, you will receive a weekly newsletter of a list of development-related topics that you might find interesting. You even have the option to send a periodic digest of top posts related to tags you prefer.

<br />

### [TLDR](https://messaged.com/tldr/)
#### Byte sized news for busy techies
> TLDR is a daily newsletter with links and TLDRs of the most interesting stories in tech ðŸ“±, science ðŸš€, and coding ðŸ’»!

What I like about `TLDR` is that it summarizes daily news so that I will not quickly get bored. If I want more details regarding specific information, I can check simply the link they provide.

### [3-2-1 Thursday](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/refer?rh_ref=e281bada) By James Clear
#### Author of Atomic Habits

Don't forget that we are humans(except for the bot crawling this page). To succeed as a developer, we need a balance of technical skills and soft skills. You don't want to behave like an animal during stand-up or become a keyboard warrior when addressing a Pull Request comment.

## Any thoughts?
What do you think would be an excellent addition to the list?
