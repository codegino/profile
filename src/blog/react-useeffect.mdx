## What is a React hook?

<br />

> ### From the React's official [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html),
> _Hooks are a new addition in React `16.8`. They let you use state and other_ 
> _React features without writing a class._

### What does it mean?
To give you more context, prior to `React v16.8`, we can only enable a component
to react to state changes using [lifecycle methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class).


```jsx
class MyClassComponent extends Component {
  // happens as soon as your component is mounted
  componentDidMount() {}

  // happens as soon as the updating begin
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {}

  // for certain performance optimizations
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {}

  // happens just before the component unmounts
  componentWillUnmount() {}

  // used when the state of a component
  // depends on changes of props
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {}

  // gets called before the most recent render output
  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {}
}
```

The main benefit of these lifecycle hooks is that
each method will have a specific


```jsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  // effect
  return () => {
    // cleanup
  }
}, [input])
```

<!-- to have a state and be able to manage it if a component is created using a `class`. -->
