## How to Handle Unhandled Rejection Errors in Remix 

> Remix will automatically catch errors and render the nearest error boundary for errors thrown while:
> - rendering in the browser
> - rendering on the server
> - in a loader during the initial server rendered document request
> - in an action during the initial server rendered document request
> - in a loader during a client-side transition in the browser (Remix serializes the error and sends it over the network to the browser)
> - in an action during a client-side transition in the browser
