## What is a React hook?

> #### From the React's official [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html),
> _Hooks are a new addition in React `16.8`. They let you use state and other_ 
> _React features without writing a class._

#### What does it mean?
To give you more context, prior to `React v16.8`, we can only enable a component
to have a state and be able to manage it if a component is created using a `class`.

```jsx live
class MyClassComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {attribute: 'some value'}
    this.handleStateChange = this.handleStateChange.bind(this)
  }

  handleStateChange(e) {
    this.setState({attribute: e.target.value})
  }

  render() {
    const {attribute} = this.state

    return <>
      <div>State: {attribute}</div>
      <input onChange={this.handleStateChange} value={attribute} />
    </>
  }
}
```

A `Functional component` is mostly used as a dumb component where
the decision on how to render it differently is derived from the `props` it will
receive from its parent component.

```jsx
function MyFunctionalComponent ({attribute, onChange}) {
  return <>
    <div>State: {attribute}</div>
    <input onChange={onChange} value={attribute} />
  </>
}
```

If you notice, we need fewer keystrokes to create a functional component,
but the problem is it would not be reactive to state changes.
Let's try to mimic all the behaviors of the `class component` to our `function component`.

```jsx live
function MyFunctionalComponent () {
  let state = {attribute: 'some value'}

  const handleStateChange = (e) => {
    state = {attribute: e.target.value}
  }

  return <>
    <div>State: {state.attribute}</div>
    <input onChange={handleStateChange} value={state.attribute} />
  </>
}
```

You can modify the component all day long, however it won't react to state changes.
<br />

What if we can have the simplicity of the `functional component` and still have
the ability to react to state changes?

<br />

#### React hooks to the rescue!

<br />

As per the title of this blog, I will only discuss `useState`
which is the solution related to our previous problem.
I will discuss the other types in another blog.

<br />

#### Here are some ways on how to can create a `useState` hook:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

...
React.useState()
React.useState(true)
React.useState([])
...

OR

import {useState} from 'react'

...
useState()
useState('default value')
useState({a: 1})
useState(() => 'value returned from a function')
...
```

As mentioned on the above examples, here's what you can pass in a `useState` as an argument:
- nothing
- primitive value
- object or array
- function _I will discuss this in another blog_
If you passed one, it will serve as the default state for that instance,
else default state will be null

<br />

When `useState` is invoked, it will return an array.
The first element is the `state` and the second element is the `state updater`.

```jsx
const stateArray = useState()
stateArray[0] // state
stateArray[1] // state updated
```

A simpler and more readable way to access `state` and `state updates` is by using
the `array destructing assignment`.
The convention for the second element is to prepend it with `set`, then make it `camelCase`.

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState()
```

Let's replicate the behavior of the class component in a function component using a `useState` hook.

```jsx live
function MyFunctionalComponent () {
  const [attribute, setAttribute] = React.useState('some value')

  const handleStateChange = (e) => {
    setAttribute(e.target.value)
  }

  return <>
    <div>State: {attribute}</div>
    <input onChange={handleStateChange} value={attribute} />
  </>
}
```

Hooray! We just created a much simpler stateful component using `useState`.
Let's breakdown what happened.

<br />

We created a new state with a default value of `some value`.
`attribute` will serve as the variable containing the default and future value of this hook.
`setAttribute` will be the function that can modify our state

```jsx
const [attribute, setAttribute] = React.useState('some value')
```

We define a method that will handle the change event from our `input` element.
```jsx
const handleStateChange = (e) => {
  setAttribute(e.target.value)
}
```

We display the `state` and attach `handleStateChange` to `onChange` event.
```jsx
return <>
  <div>State: {attribute}</div>
  <input onChange={handleStateChange} value={attribute} />
</>
```

_You can also simplify further if you want_
```jsx
  <input onChange={e => setAttribute(e.target.value)} value={attribute} />
```

<br />

#### Does it mean we should not use a `class component` ever again?
For me, I always use the `functional component` approach, but if I'm working on a very old codebase where
there's no way to migrate to the newer version, then I will definitely use a `class component`.
Also, it is written in the React documentation that `There are no plans to remove classes from React`.
There are some use cases like the when using Inheritance, creating Error Boundary, explicit lifecycle methods, and such
that cannot be directly done using a `functional component`,
although there are many workarounds to apply the expected behavior.

<br />
<br />

## Conclusion
`useState` will simplify how we can create a component.
Fewer code means lesser bugs(_if used properly_) and easier to read, which results in better maintainability.
