## How can we avoid exposing API keys to the browser

> ### TL;DR
> Create an [API handler](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) which will call the external API with the sensitive API key, then call that handler from the client-side.

### The problem

Here's an example of how to call an API with a required API key.

```jsx
const API_URL= 'https://www.test.com/api'
const API_KEY = 'some-secret-key'

useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`${API_URL}/hello?apiKey=${API_KEY}`)
  // ...
}, [])
```

Of course, we don't want it to be hardcoded or committed to the repo; As a workaround, we can create an environment variable.

```jsx
const API_URL = proccess.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXTERNAL_API_HOST
const API_KEY = proccess.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY;

useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`${API_URL}/hello?apiKey=${API_KEY}`)
  // ...
}, [])
```

> If you're wondering why variables start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` you can refer to this [blog](https://codegino.com/blog/next-js-environment-variables)

Using the above example will surely help us not leak the API key in our codebase; however, it is still accessible to the client-side.

<br />

Go to the Network tab in the browser, and you'll see the API key in the request headers.

### Solution

As mentioned in the `TL;DR` section, we can prevent the exposure of API keys if the code is running on the server.

The good thing is that Next.js is not only a client-side framework but is also used to run server-side code.

> Check this documentation to learn about creating an [API in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

#### Here's the general steps

1. Remove the `NEXT_PUBLIC` in the variable name(e.g. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` to `API_KEY`)
2. Create a handler named `hello.js` under `pages/api`.
3. Move the API call to the handler with the updated environment variable.

```js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const data = await fetch(
    `https://www.test.com/api/hello?apiKey=${process.env.API_KEY}`,
  ).then(response => response.json());

  res.json(data); // Send the response
}
```
The handler above is accessible via `localhost:3000/api/hello` in a local environment or `https://www.ourhost.com/api/hello` in production.

<br />

But since we are pointing to the same host, we use `window.location.origin` to avoid hardcoding the path or creating unnecessary environment variables.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`${window.location.origin}/api/hello`)
  // ...
}, [])
```

The API key should not be visible in the browser as the external API call executes from the server.

## Conclusion
This article might be anti-climactic as the solution is very similar to all other solutions we've seen so far.
However, it is worth mentioning that in Next.js, forwarding an API call to the server is straightforward since Next.js can be both a client and a server.
