## Why do we need to pass a _callback function_ to the _useState_ function

> ### TL;DR version
>
> We can pass a callback function when calling `useState` to take advantage of lazy initialization.
>
> This will resolve the source of the state only once, thus avoiding unnecessary computation during re-renders.


### Longer version

When we develop real production application, it's not always that we derive our state from simple primitive values.
Sometimes we need to calculate them based on other values as shown below.

```jsx
const [state1, setState1] = useState(prop1 === prop2 && prop2 !== prop3 && prop1 < prop3)
const [state2, setState2] = useState(prop4 === prop5 && prop5 !== prop6 && prop4 < prop6)
```

You might notice the logics to get the default value are very identical so as a good programmer,
we can extract the logic to a new function to avoid duplication.
```jsx
function reusableFunctionToGetState(first, second, third)  {
  return first === second && second !== third && first < third
}

// We call the function with the appropriate arguments. 
const [state1, setState1] = useState(reusableFunctionToGetState(prop1, prop2, prop3));
const [state2, setState2] = useState(reusableFunctionToGetState(prop4, prop5, prop6));
```

The problem occurs when the source of our state is computationally expensive.
Everytime we re-render our component we need to re-evaluate our default state.
Try to see the problem by playing with the code below.

```jsx live
function UseStateDemo() {
  const complexFunction = () => {
    // Something computationally expensive
    // Try uncommenting any of the lines below
    // console.log('Finding the meaning of life')
    // alert('Finding the meaning of life')
    return 'result of a heavy task'
  }

  const [,setState] = React.useState(complexFunction())

  return <button onClick={() => setState(Date.now())} >Click Me</button>
}
```

Each time we click the button, the `complexFunction` will always be called(_verify by uncommenting console.log or alert_).
If that `complexFunction` is really computationally expensive then expect our component will render slower.

<br />

### Solution: perform a lazy initialization

For a such big word like `lazy initialization` it actually is very simple.
We simply need pass a function instead of a value as shown below.
```jsx
const [,setState] = React.useState(() => complexFunction())
// OR
const [,setState] = React.useState(complexFunction)
```

<br />

Try to play with the code below and see the difference
```jsx live
function SetStateDemo() {
  const complexFunction = () => {
    // Something computationally expensive
    // Try uncommenting any of the lines below
    // console.log('Finding the meaning of life')
    // alert('Finding the meaning of life')
    return 'result of a heavy task'
  }

  const [,setState] = React.useState(() => complexFunction)
  // const [,setState] = React.useState(complexFunction) // Alternatively

  return <button onClick={() => setState(Date.now())} >Click Me</button>
}
```

The `complexFunction` will be evaluated only once if we pass it as a function
and not invoking it immediately, thus giving us a performance boost.

<br />

### Do we need to always lazy initializate our state?
Definitely not. It's not magic that allows lazy initialization to do the above optimization.
There's an overhead to it which means if we use everywhere it,
it could make our component "slower" in contrast to our goal to make it faster.

<br />
<br />

## Conclusion
Use lazy initialization when your state dependends on something that is computationally heavy.
Avoid unnecessary "_optimization_"; lazy initialization has a small overhead, so use it wisely.
