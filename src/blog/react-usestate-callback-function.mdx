## Why do we need to pass a _callback function_ to the _useState_ function

> ### TL;DR version
>
> We can pass a callback function when calling `useState` to take advantage of lazy initialization.
>
> This will resolve the source of the state only once, thus avoiding unnecessary computation during re-renders.


### Longer version

When we develop real production applications, we do not always derive our state from simple primitive values.
Sometimes we need to calculate them based on other values, as shown below.

```jsx
const [state1, setState1] = useState(prop1 === prop2 && prop2 !== prop3 && prop1 < prop3)
const [state2, setState2] = useState(prop4 === prop5 && prop5 !== prop6 && prop4 < prop6)
```

You might notice the logics to get the default value are very identical so as a good programmer,
we can extract the logic to a new function to avoid duplication.
```jsx
function reusableFunctionToGetState(first, second, third)  {
  return first === second && second !== third && first < third
}

// We call the function with the appropriate arguments. 
const [state1, setState1] = useState(reusableFunctionToGetState(prop1, prop2, prop3));
const [state2, setState2] = useState(reusableFunctionToGetState(prop4, prop5, prop6));
```

The problem occurs when the source of our state is computationally expensive.
Every time we re-render our component, we need to re-evaluate our default state.
Try to see the problem by playing with the code below.

```jsx codePenID=RwZOrdJ
function UseStateDemo() {
  const complexFunction = () => {
    // Something computationally expensive
    return 'result of a heavy task'
  }

  const [,setState] = React.useState(complexFunction())

  return <button onClick={() => setState(Date.now())} >Click Me</button>
}
```

Each time we click the button, the `complexFunction` will always be called(_verify by uncommenting console.log or alert_).
If that `complexFunction` is computationally expensive, then expect our component will render slower.

<br />

### Solution: perform a lazy initialization

For a such big word like `lazy initialization` it actually is very simple.
We simply need pass a function instead of a value as shown below.
```jsx
const [,setState] = React.useState(() => complexFunction())
// OR
const [,setState] = React.useState(complexFunction)
```

<br />

Try to play with the code below and see the difference
```jsx codePenID=zYdXrXo
function SetStateDemo() {
  const complexFunction = () => {
    // Something computationally expensive
    return 'result of a heavy task'
  }

  const [,setState] = React.useState(() => complexFunction)
  // const [,setState] = React.useState(complexFunction) // Alternatively

  return <button onClick={() => setState(Date.now())} >Click Me</button>
}
```

The `complexFunction` will evaluate only once if we pass it as a function
and not invoking it immediately, thus giving us a performance boost.

<br />

### Do we need to always lazy initialize our state?
No. It's not magic that allows lazy initialization to do the above optimization.
There's an overhead to it which means if we use it everywhere,
it could make our component "slower" in contrast to our goal to make it faster.

<br />
<br />

## Conclusion
Use lazy initialization when your state depends on something that is computationally heavy.
Avoid unnecessary "_optimization_"; lazy initialization has a small overhead, so use it wisely.
