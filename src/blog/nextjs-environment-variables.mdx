### How to create an environment variable for Next.js

<br />

#### First, create a file with a starting in `.env`.

Depending on the run-time environment, a custom `.env` file can be created suce as the following:
- `.env.development` - when running `next dev`
- `.env.production` - when running `next start`
- `.env.local` - will override `.env`, `.env.development`, and `.env.production`
- `.env.test` - when running `jest` OR `cypress`
- host environment variables - AWS, Heroku, Vecel, etc. provide an interface to set environment variables directly

#### Next, inside the created `.env` file, add the variables to be used

```.env
VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE
```

This will be accessible via `proccess.env`

```js
console.log(process.env.VARIABLE_NAME);
```

### Two types of environment variables

1. Server-side expose variables
2. Browser exposed variables

<br />

#### 1. Server-side variables

Every variable set in an `.env*` file will be available on the server-side. *Including the second type*

```.env
DB_HOST=secret_host
DB_USERNAME=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

<br />

Above variables can be used in the server-side code such as `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or in `/api`

```js
export function getStaticProps() {
  connectToDatabase({
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    username: process.env.DB_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  })
}
```

#### 2. Browser exposed variables

Accessing the sample variables above will yield undefine.
In order to make a variable available to the browser, it should be prepended with `NEXT_PULIC_`.

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=abcde12345
NEXT_PUBLIC_NOT_SO_SECRET_URL=https://example.com
```

Even though there will be more keystrokes, I like this convention as it clearly distinguishes what variables are available to the client-side.
It is less likely that I will expose any sensitive information to the user.

<br />

As per the variables above, it can be used anywhere in React land. For example, when setting the Google analytics key.

```jsx
// _document.tsx
<Head>
 <script
  async
  src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS}`}
 />
</Head>
```

<br />

Another usage is for something publicly accessible but should not be committed to the repo.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NOT_SO_SECRET_URL}`)
  // ...
})
```

> Although you can still access a browser exposed variable in your server-side code, it will not make sense to do it.

> Make sure any sensitive information should not be committed in the repo.


## Conclusion

Next.js provides an easy way to set environment variables in any run-time environment.
It also provides a good convention to separate variables that can be used on the client-side.
