Jason awoke to unfamiliar sounds replacing the city's usual hum. The chirping of unknown birds and the rustling of leaves were a stark contrast to the honking of cars he was used to. Refreshed and invigorated, he found himself in the heart of vast grassy fields, a far cry from the concrete and steel structures of his city.

<br />

The vibrant green fields under the clear, blue sky stretched endlessly, surrounded by majestic mountains with cloud-kissed peaks. A serene river flowed between the mountains, its clear waters sparkling in the sunlight. The trees caught his attention the most, with their twisted trunks, shimmering leaves, and giant-like branches.

<br />

Suddenly, a thought struck him. This scenario was eerily similar to the countless fantasy and sci-fi shows and books he had consumed. "I've watched too much fiction. I must be dreaming of an alternate world," he said to himself, a mix of excitement and fear coursing through him.

<br />

Overwhelmed by the beauty of his surroundings, he rubbed his eyes, a hint of worry creeping into his voice. "This place... it's breathtaking, just like in the stories I love," he murmured to himself. "But I know those stories. They're filled with monsters and danger. I need to see the real world now. I want to go back."

<br />

As his words faded, he felt a sudden spark, like a jolt of electricity originating from his brain and traveling down to his left eye. This unexpected sensation startled him, and then a voice echoed in his mind, "[[Eye of debugger]], activated." When he removed his hand and opened his eyes, his vision had shifted.

<br />

His right eye was seeing the world as he knew it - the trees, the sky, the ground beneath him. But his left eye was seeing something entirely different. It was as if he was looking at a digital representation of the world around him. Rows of cryptic symbols and glowing grids that he couldn't understand filled his vision, overlaying the physical world. It was as if he was seeing the digital blueprint of the world around him.

<br />

Feeling dizzy from the conflicting views, Jason closed his right eye, allowing him to focus solely on the digital view presented by his left eye. As he tried to make sense of what he was seeing, his gaze landed on a small rock near him. The symbols that compose the rock were in a language he couldn't understand. However, when he focused his vision on the cryptic object, an interactive menu appeared around it. His instincts told him that one of the options was "decompile", even though he couldn't read the accurately. Driven by curiosity, he decided to explore this further.

<br />

Suddenly, upon focusing on the "decompile" option, it was as if he had selected it. The cryptic lines of symbols and diagrams started to swirl and shift before his eyes, like a complex puzzle rearranging itself. As they settled, they transformed into a form that seemed to resonate with Jason's understanding. Additional information appeared around the rock, like its color, weight, and other properties. Despite the symbols not being conventionally readable, Jason found himself instinctively grasping their meaning.

<br />

Excited by this discovery, Jason decided to experiment further. He moved his hand closer to the rock, intending to touch it. But as his fingers neared the rock, he felt an unexpected feedback, a sensation akin to typing on a keyboard.

<br />

"Whoa, what was that?" Jason exclaimed, pulling his hand back in surprise. He tried moving his fingers again, as if typing in the air. With each motion, he noticed the information about the rock changing. "It's like... I'm navigating through the rock's properties," he muttered to himself, his eyes wide with fascination.

<br />

Intrigued, he focused on the color property of the rock. He could see the symbol 'color is gray' hovering near the rock. Wondering if he could change the value, he started searching for a way. "How can I change this color?" he mused aloud, his fingers moving in the air as if scrolling through options.

<br />

Then, with a determined whisper, he said to himself, "I need to find blue. Where is it? I want it... blue." To his amazement, the symbol changed from 'color is gray' to 'color is blue'.

<br />

"Value selection by mind, what a feature!" Jason murmured, staring at the now-blue symbol. He opened his right eye to confirm, and sure enough, the rock in the physical world had also changed. It was now a brilliant shade of sapphire blue, matching his visualization perfectly.

<br />

Taking a moment to let the reality of what just happened sink in, he looked at his hands, then back at the transformed rock. "It's like I've been using this virtual keyboard all my life. Even though it's completely new to me, it feels... instinctive, natural," he said to himself, marveling at his newfound ability to interact with the digital representation of the world around him.

<br />

Feeling a renewed sense of energy, Jason decided to explore his surroundings. "I need to find a safe place, somewhere to rest and gather my thoughts," he muttered to himself, his eyes scanning the environment.

<br />

As he ventured further into the fields, he noticed an unusual shape in the distance. "What's that?" he wondered aloud, squinting at the large monolith. "Looks like a statue. Statues usually mean civilization, right? Maybe there's a village or something nearby. Definitely worth checking out."

<br />

As he drew closer, the ground beneath him began to tremble. "What the...?" Jason exclaimed, freezing in place as a low rumble filled the air.

<br />

Suddenly, a thunderous sound echoed across the fields. Jason turned towards the source of the noise and found himself staring at a massive, bull-like creature charging towards him. "Oh no, this isn't good," he gasped, his heart pounding in his chest. Despite its fearsome appearance, Jason noticed that the creature seemed weakened. "It's struggling... but what's causing it?" he wondered aloud, his mind racing as he tried to figure out his next move.

<br />

The sight of the massive, bull-like creature charging towards him sent a jolt of fear through Jason. He turned on his heels and started running towards the boulder, his eyes scanning the surroundings for something, anything, he could use to his advantage.

<br />

Remembering the myth about bulls being attracted to the color red, Jason chuckled nervously to himself. "If I can make that boulder red," he thought aloud, his voice shaky, "it might distract this creature, giving me a chance to escape."

<br />

With a deep breath, he focused on the boulder. As he did, he felt a familiar sensation in his left eye. A voice echoed in his mind, "[[Eye of Debugger]], activated." His vision shifted, and he could see the underlying properties that made up the boulder.

<br />

With his fingers in the air, he navigated the properties of the boulder as if typing on an invisible keyboard. He visualized the color property changing to red.

<br />

The boulder responded instantly, turning a vibrant, fiery red so bright it was almost blinding. As soon as the transformation occurred, Jason turned on his heels and started running away from the boulder. But as he dared to glance back, his heart sank. The bull-like creature was not swayed by the dazzling red boulder. Its menacing eyes were still locked on him, ignoring the red distraction.

<br />

As it drew closer, Jason realized with a jolt of fear that it was massive - at least five times the size of any bull he'd seen before. It continued its charge, aiming for where Jason was heading. Despite its weakened state, the creature was still faster than Jason and was quickly closing the distance. The reality of his situation hit him like a punch to the gut - he was still in danger.

<br />

As Jason was running away from the charging bull, he spotted a group of figures at the edge of the field. They were villagers, their hands raised as they chanted in unison.

<br />

"Help!" Jason shouted, his voice hoarse with fear. "I mean no harm! But that bull... it doesn't seem to want to make friends!"

<br />

His call for help echoed across the field, reaching the villagers. They exchanged quick glances, their chant faltering for a moment. Then, as if coming to a silent agreement, they resumed their chant with renewed determination.

<br />

Just as the bull was about to reach Jason, the villagers' chanting got louder. Suddenly, a towering wall of iron, as tall as a two-story building and as thick as a large tree trunk, shot up from the ground, blocking the bull's path.

<br />

With a loud crash, the bull hit the iron wall. The impact was so strong it shook the ground, and a large dent appeared on the wall where the bull had hit. Dust and small fragments of iron flew into the air. The bull tried to push forward, but it was no use. It staggered back, dazed by the impact, then fell to the ground, knocked out cold.

<br />

Jason, catching his breath, turned towards the villagers. His eyes, still adjusting to the dual vision, widened in amazement as he took in the sight of the iron wall that had saved him. As he watched, the wall started to dissolve, turning into bytes of data that disappeared into thin air. "Where did that come from?" he muttered to himself, his voice shaky, his eyes shifting back and forth between the disappearing wall and the villagers in disbelief.

<br />

A hushed silence fell upon the villagers, stretching out for what felt like an eternity. Five minutes ticked by, each passing second filled with anticipation and curiosity. Their eyes, filled with a mixture of awe and concern, remained fixed on Jason, their gazes dissecting every detail of his being.

<br />

Whispers of realization and recognition rippled through the crowd, as if a secret language was being exchanged among them. Their expressions shifted, revealing a range of emotions - surprise, intrigue, and a hint of worry. They had noticed something extraordinary about Jason, something that resonated deeply within their own clan's abilities. However, the villagers traditional attire, vibrant and intricately patterned, stood in stark contrast to his own outfit - black jogging pants, a blue t-shirt, and flip-flops. It was clear that his modern attire had left them puzzled, their brows furrowed with concern.

<br />

Stepping forward, an older man with a kind face and gentle eyes addressed him, their voice carrying reassurance. "You're safe now, young person. Welcome to our village."

<br />

Jason nodded, grateful for their help, his mind racing with questions. It was the first time he had ever heard their language, yet somehow, he understood every word. The mysterious connection left him both amazed and bewildered.

<br />

A murmur rippled through the group, their eyes filled with a mix of curiosity and wonder. They exchanged glances, their silent communication speaking volumes. "Look at the monolith," one of the villagers whispered, her voice filled with awe. Her eyes widened as she continued, "It's not like anything we've seen before. The transformation... it's more vibrant, more alive. It's as if the monolith itself has transformed into a giant ember."

<br />

The villagers held their breath, their anticipation growing with each passing moment. They waited, their eyes fixed on the monolith, seeking further confirmation of the extraordinary phenomenon unfolding before them. The air was charged with a sense of excitement and reverence, as if they were witnessing a long-awaited prophecy come to life.

<br />

The elder of the group, a man with an aged face and gentle eyes, stroked his beard thoughtfully. "The legend speaks of a hero who could become one with the world," he said to Jason, his voice carrying a note of hope. "A hero who could permanently interact with the world in a way no one else could. Could you be...?"

<br />

As this realization dawned upon the villagers, their expressions shifted from neutral curiosity to awe and hope. "The hero from the legend," the elder finished, his voice filled with reverence. "He's finally here."

<br />

Exhausted but relieved, Jason managed a weak smile as his eyes slowly closed. His adventure in this magical realm was just beginning. As he drifted into unconsciousness, he caught sight of the villagers' smiling faces, their eyes reflecting the dawn of a new era. His last thoughts were a mix of confusion and humor. "Hero? Legend? What are they talking about?" he mused, a faint smile on his lips. "Oh... whatever. At least they are not mad at me for turning that boulder into a big red traffic light." Little did he know, his actions had sparked a beacon of hope among the villagers.
